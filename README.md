# Classification-of-Galaxies
How effectively can classification accuracy be achieved using ResNet over CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architecture to classify galaxies using Hubbleâ€™s scheme?

Galaxy classification is a crucial task in astronomy, allowing researchers to gain insights into the formation, evolution, and properties of these celestial bodies. One of the most widely used classification schemes is based on the morphological shapes of galaxies, as proposed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s. Hubble categorized galaxies into three main types: elliptical, spiral, and irregular.
For this classification task, a dataset named "Galaxy Zoo 2 Images" has been obtained from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaimetrickz/galaxy-zoo-2-images). This dataset contains 243,434 images of different types of galaxies, providing a rich and diverse collection for analysis. The primary objective is to develop an automated system capable of classifying these images into their respective Hubble types based on their visual characteristics.
The accurate classification of these galaxy morphologies using deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and residual networks (ResNets), holds great promise for advancing our knowledge in this field. Leveraging the large dataset of galaxy images, these powerful models can learn to identify and distinguish the intricate patterns and features associated with each galaxy type.
